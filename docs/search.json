A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100 percents ) expresses maximal inequality among values (for example where only one person has all the income).\nraref Rarefaction is a technique to assess species richness from the results of sampling through extrapolation."

Users can select their preferred palette type (sequential or diverging), then choose and arrange the input colors. They can subsequently review and adjust the resulting palette before exporting the color codes."
