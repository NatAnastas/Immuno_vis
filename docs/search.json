The method parameter similarly to above mentioned functions sets the means for diversity estimation. You can choose one of the following methods:\n\nshannon Shannon index takes into account both the number of different species and the distribution of individuals among those species, providing a single numerical value that reflects the diversity within a community. Higher Shannon index values indicate greater diversity.\nchao1 Chao is a nonparameteric asymptotic estimator of species richness (number of species in a population).\nhill Hill numbers are a mathematically unified family of diversity indices (differing only by an exponent q).\ndiv true diversity, or the effective number of types, refers to the number of equally abundant types needed for the average proportional abundance of the types to equal that observed in the dataset of interest where all types may not be equally abundant.\ngini.simp The Gini-Simpson index is the probability of interspecific encounter, i.e., probability that two entities represent different types.\ninv.simp Inverse Simpson index is the effective number of types that is obtained when the weighted arithmetic mean is used to quantify average proportional abundance of types in the dataset of interest.\ngini The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution (for example levels of income). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (for example, where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100 percents ) expresses maximal inequality among values (for example where only one person has all the income).\nraref Rarefaction is a technique to assess species richness from the results of sampling through extrapolation."

To select a specific color, users can copy the code by simply clicking on the desired color.\nContinuous palettes enable smooth transitions between colors, offering a diverse range of options. Discrete palettes consist of a fixed number of colors, whereas dynamic palettes, a subset of discrete palettes, can adapt to generate a variable number of colors as needed."
