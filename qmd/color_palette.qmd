Below you can find a list of website helping you to find out different color palettes.

## [R color paletters](https://r-charts.com/color-palettes/)

The site has three distinct categories of color palettes. Continuous palettes offer smooth transitions between colors, providing a wide spectrum of possibilities. Discrete palettes contain a set number of colors, while dynamic palettes, a subset of discrete palettes, can generate a variable number of colors as required.
